    ("Vector Representations (Neural Networks)", "Advanced text representation", "Captures context and semantic meaning; adaptable to different contexts.", "Requires large datasets; computationally intensive."),
    ("Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", "Sequence prediction", "Good at capturing long-range dependencies; handles varying-length input sequences well.", "Slower to train; complex model architecture."),
    ("Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)", "Feature extraction from text", "Efficient for local pattern recognition (e.g., phrases); parallelizable architecture.", "Less effective for long-range dependencies."),
    ("Recursive Networks", "Hierarchical data processing", "Good for hierarchical problems like parsing; captures nested structure.", "Can be difficult to train; less popular due to difficulty in optimization."),
    ("Support Vector Machine (SVM)", "Binary classification", "Effective in high-dimensional spaces; works well with clear margin of separation.", "Not suitable for larger datasets; requires careful kernel choice."),
    ("Logistic Regression", "Probability estimation", "Simple; outputs probabilities for outcomes; good interpretability.", "Assumes linear relationships; not suitable for complex relationships."),
    ("Softmax Function", "Multiclass classification", "Directly generalizes logistic regression to multiple classes.", "Assumes independence among classes; can be computationally expensive for many classes."),
    ("TF-IDF", "Weighted text representation", "Emphasizes important words; reduces weight of common words across documents.", "Ignores semantics and context; purely statistical approach."),
    ("CNN-LSTM", "Combined feature and sequence learning", "Combines local features extraction with sequence modeling; robust to sequence and spatial inputs.", "Complex to implement and tune; computationally intensive."),
    ("Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)", "Sequence prediction", "Can process sequences of data; useful for text where order matters.", "Prone to vanishing and exploding gradient problems; challenging to train."),
    ("FastCNNs", "Efficient feature extraction", "Faster than traditional CNNs; suitable for real-time applications.", "May sacrifice some accuracy for speed; less effective for very complex patterns."),
    ("Bayesian Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers", "Probabilistic classification", "Incorporates prior knowledge; good for small datasets.", "Assumes independence among features; poor with correlated features."),
    ("Absolute Deviation Factor-based methods (ADF-CTF, ADF-CDF, ADF-CTDF)", "Feature selection", "Reduces dimensionality by selecting features based on their deviation.", "May discard useful information; effectiveness depends on the distribution of data."),
    ("Binary Poor and Rich Optimization Algorithm (HBPRO)", "Feature selection and optimization", "Optimizes feature selection in binary classification tasks; potentially improves accuracy.", "Complex to understand and implement; may be computationally expensive.")
